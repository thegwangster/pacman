In this problem, you are asked to implement the AC-3 algorithm to solve
Sudoku puzzles. You'll want to familiarize yourself with the code in
sudoku.py.

You'll run your code like this:

python3 sudoku.py sudoku_single.txt

You'll want to test whether your algorithm can solve a variety of Sudoku
puzzles. You can do so by running

python3 sudoku.py sudokus.txt

The code as provided will actually work, and solve a few puzzles, but it
only does so without AC-3. As you will see if you run the code now, some
puzzles can be solved easily without AC-3, but some will take much longer
to solve. Adding AC-3 should make solving these puzzles much faster.

Make sure you test your code well and that you thoroughly understand the
AC-3 algorithm! It's easy to write a solution that will work, but not 
reduce domains as well as it could.
